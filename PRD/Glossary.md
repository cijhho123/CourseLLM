## Purpose

This glossary defines standard terminology used throughout the CourseLLM project. All team members, documentation, and code should use these terms consistently to avoid ambiguity and ensure clear communication.

---

## A

### Academic Integrity

The ethical code and policy framework that ensures students complete coursework honestly, without unauthorized assistance. CourseLLM promotes academic integrity by encouraging understanding over answer-seeking.

### Acceptance Criteria

Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for a user story or feature to be considered complete and acceptable to stakeholders.

### Active Student

A student who has interacted with the CourseLLM system (e.g., asked questions, attempted practice problems) within a specified time period, typically measured weekly or monthly.

### Aggregated Data

Statistics computed across multiple students at the class level, with no individual student identification possible. Used to preserve student privacy while providing insights to instructors.

### AI Resistance Score

A numerical measure (0.0 to 1.0) indicating how difficult an assignment is to solve using general-purpose AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) without genuine understanding of course material. Higher scores indicate greater resistance.

### Assignment

A formal assessment created by an instructor, consisting of one or more questions or problems that students must complete by a specified deadline for credit toward their course grade.

### Assignment Validation

The automated process of testing whether an assignment can be solved by directly prompting AI tools, used to ensure assignments require genuine understanding rather than AI shortcuts.
