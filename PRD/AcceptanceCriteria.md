## 10. Contingency Plans

### 10.1 Rollback Criteria

System will be rolled back to previous version if:

-   Critical security vulnerability discovered (exploitable)
-   Data loss or corruption occurs
-   System availability drops below 90% for > 4 hours
-   Error rate exceeds 10% for > 1 hour
-   Instructor requests halt due to academic concerns

**Rollback Process:** Documented procedure, <1 hour rollback time target

### 10.2 Feature Flags

All major features must have feature flags to allow:

-   Gradual rollout (percentage-based)
